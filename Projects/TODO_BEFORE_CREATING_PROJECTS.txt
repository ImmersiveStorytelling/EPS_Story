When making a new project, we only push necessary files to Github and not those that do not have an effect on the development of the project. This means we'll have to create those files before we start working remotely on a project.

Here is how to do it:

1. Create project on source device (VR Desktop with Unity latest version, in this case 2017.3.1f1)
2. Copy the gitignore file from the upper folder in the folder of the project (this blocks all unnecessary files)
3. "git add .", "commit -m "create project X"", and push to github (pull before you push)
4. On your remote device you now have access towards the files on github, but not a complete Unity project. Pull from github so you have the files stored on your remote device
5. Open Unity in same version as the source of the project (VR Desktop with Unity version 2017.3.1f1)
6. Create a new Unity 3D project (temporarily) next to the map where the files of the desired project are located
7. When building is finished, open the new temporarily project folder (from your remote device), press ctrl + A and copy everything inside this folder
8. Go to the folder of the desired project (which is incomplete) and paste everything. !!!The device will prompt to ask wether you you to overwrite already existing files or skip them. Make sure you SKIP THE ALREADY EXISTING FILES. Do not overwrite.
9. Delete the temporarily project you created for generating the missing project files. (Do not push this to github. If you have pushed, see beneath*)
10. Now you can work on the project remotely


In case of pushing something unwanted to github, do next steps:
1. Delete the file/folder from you device
2. "git add ."
3. "git commit -a -m "delete X"
4. push to github
