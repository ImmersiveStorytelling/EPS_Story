When the project is already created on another device, we will only have access to the development files. This means this is not a full Unity project.

To be able to work on the project in Unity, to the following steps:
1. Go to the folder in the upper map which is called "Unity_Template_Project" and enter it.
2. Copy all files in this folder (CTRL + A, then CTRL + V => command for Apple)
3. Go to the project on which to work and open it
4. Paste all the files you copied (CTRL + V)
5. !!! The computer will prompt to ask to overwrite or skip already existing files. Make sure that you SKIP THE ALREADY EXISTING FILES. Do not overwrite them.
6. Open the project in Unity and the rest will be automatically generated.
