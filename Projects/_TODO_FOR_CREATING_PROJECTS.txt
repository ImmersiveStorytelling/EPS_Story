When making a new project, we only push necessary files to Github and not those that do not have an effect on the development of the project. This means we'll have to create those files before we start working remotely on a project.

We have a template from which we will ALWAYS create a new project. This template will be the source of new updates and important changes.

Here is how to do it:

1. In the repo, there is a folder named "Unity_Template_Project". Copy this folder.
2. Go in the folder "Projects"
3. Paste the copied folder (keep a clean structure)
4. Change name of the folder to the desired name
5. Add two next folders in de Asset folder* (store these two folders locally so you don't have to download it everytime):
	- SteamVR: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin => enter "Assets" and the folder SteamVR is the one you need to copy to your own "Assets" folder
	- VRTK: https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK.git  => same as above, but with VRTK folder
6. Open the project in Unity (other needed files will be automatically generated)


In case of pushing something unwanted to github, do next steps:
1. Delete the file/folder from you device
2. "git add ."
3. "git commit -a -m "delete X"
4. push to github

* We use SteamVR for developing in Unity with the VR headset. VRTK is used for developing without a headset, which uses a VR simulator. If working with headseat (default), disable (checkbox left of name in Inspector box): VRTK_SDK Manager and VRTK_SDK Setup objects in the scene. If working without headset, enable VRTK objects and disable [CameraRig] object.
